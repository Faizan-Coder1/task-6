# 📊 Sales Trend Analysis Using SQL Aggregations

## 📝 Overview
This project is the solution for **Data Analyst Internship – Task 6**, which involves analyzing **monthly revenue** and **order volumes** from an `online_sales` dataset using SQL aggregations.

We use a **SQLite** database for demonstration, but SQL queries are compatible with **PostgreSQL** and **MySQL**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Group data by **year and month**
- Aggregate:
  - **Monthly revenue** (SUM)
  - **Order volume** (COUNT DISTINCT order_id)
- Demonstrate:
  - COUNT vs COUNT(DISTINCT)
  - NULL handling
  - ORDER BY vs GROUP BY
  - Top 3 months by sales
